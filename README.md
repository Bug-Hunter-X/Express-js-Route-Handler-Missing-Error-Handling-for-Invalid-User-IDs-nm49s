# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User IDs

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers:  missing error handling for invalid input.  Specifically, the `/users/:id` route attempts to parse the `id` parameter as an integer without any validation or error handling.  This can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior if the ID is not a valid number.

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with improved error handling.

## Bug

The primary issue is the lack of input validation.  The code assumes the `userId` will always be a parsable integer. If a non-numeric string is provided, `parseInt(userId)` will return `NaN`, leading to a failed search and a potential crash depending on the implementation of `users.find()`.

## Solution

The solution involves adding input validation and error handling:

1. **Type checking:** Verify that `userId` is a number.
2. **Error handling:** If the ID is invalid or the user is not found, return a proper error response (e.g., 400 Bad Request or 404 Not Found).

The improved code ensures robustness and prevents unexpected crashes or incorrect responses.
